## *Project 3 – [Big Data Wrangling with Google Books Ngrams](https://github.com/lalanamika/big-data-wrangling-google-ngrams)*
**Overview:** In this project, I applied the skills to analyze a vast real-world dataset. The dataset, Google Ngrams, represents a substantial portion of digitized books throughout history, hosted on Amazon S3. My workflow involved setting up an EMR cluster with Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Jupyterhub, and Livy. I loaded, filtered, and visualized the data, which was stored in CSV format on S3. Using PySpark, I performed data exploration, filtering, and analysis, including plotting token occurrences over time. Additionally, I compared Hadoop and Spark as distributed file systems, highlighting their key advantages and differences.
- **Dataset:** 261 million rows of [Google Ngrams dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/google-ngrams/)
- **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pyspark, Spark SQL, HDFS, AWS EMR Cluster, Plotly
- **Category:** Big Data Analysis
- **Year:** July 2024

## *Project 4 – Sentiment Analysis for Hotel Reviews*
**Overview:** Utilized NLP to preprocess the hotel review text data, did data wrangling and feature engineering. Employed different machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree to predict the likelihood of rating. Evaluated the model predictions using appropriate evaluation metrics and visualized the confusion matrix.
- **Dataset:** 515,000 rows of hotel reviews
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, NLP, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Grid Search
- **Category:** Classification
- **Year:** June 2024


## *Project 5 – Statistical Analysis - West Nile Virus Dataset*
**Overview:** Used StatsModel modules (chi2 test, ANOVA, linear and logistic regression) to perform statistical EDA and interpret the correlation between variables and the WNV presence in Chicago between 2008 and 2019.
- **Dataset:** 20,000 rows of WNV Mosquito Test Results from [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/West-Nile-Virus-WNV-Mosquito-Test-Results/jqe8-8r6s/about_data)
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, StatsModel, Chi2, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
- **Category:** Hypothesis Testing, Statistical Analysis
- **Year:** May 2024
